My research interests lie in evolutionary biology and primarily aim to understand how organisms cope with rapid environmental heterogeneity. I have studied behaviour, micro-habitat, performance, and morphology of animals in environments that differ in temperature, structure, and community. Below is a brief outline of my research. Currently my research focuses on quantitative genetics with a main focus on genotype-by-environment interactions.
