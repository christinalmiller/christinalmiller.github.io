My research interests lie in evolutionary biology and primarily aim to understand how organisms cope with rapid environmental heterogeneity. I have studied behaviour, micro-habitat, performance, and morphology of animals in environments that differ in temperature, structure, and community. Below is a brief outline of my research. Currently my research focuses on quantitative genetics with a main focus on genotype-by-environment interactions.


###### Current Research

####The plant evolution project  | ![capsella drawing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127891763/234720518-41387cec-1c7c-4167-b002-7b8fb5cb7629.png)

Urbanisation is happening on a rapid scale around the world, providing a new dynamic to many ecosystems. This process can often cause extremes in many abiotic factors. While many animals can shift their ranges to help buffer against some of these extremes, the survival of plants relies on species' ability to mitigate stress over a relatively short timescale.  

Studying how plants can adapt to urban environments not only adds to current knowledge on the effects of urbanisation, but this research can also provide insight into adaptation to rapidly-changing novel environments and therefore contributes to understanding some of the fundemental concepts in evolutionary biology. 

*Capsella bursa-pastoris* (Shepherdâ€™s purse, *Brassicaceae*) is a self-fertilising annual plant. While this species is native to eastern Europe and western Asia, it has naturalised in many parts of the world, including North America. 

For this project, we will be collecting *Capsella bursa-pastoris* seeds from five large cities in the mid-west region of the states and growing them in a common garden experiment. We aim to determine the contribution of adaptation and plasticity to survival of these plants in an urban landscape. We also aim to determine the genetic variation of *Capsella bursa-pastoris* populations across cities, and potentially do some DNA sequencing to determine the relatedness of populations.
