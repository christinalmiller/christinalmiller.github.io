My research interests lie in evolutionary biology and primarily aim to understand how organisms cope with rapid environmental heterogeneity. I have studied behaviour, micro-habitat, performance, and morphology of animals in environments that differ in temperature, structure, and community. Below is a brief outline of my research. Currently my research is in the field of quantitative genetics, with a main focus on genotype-by-environment interactions.

##### The plant evolution project 

Urbanisation is happening on a rapid scale around the world, providing a new dynamic to many ecosystems. This process can often cause extremes in many abiotic factors.
While many animals can shift their ranges to help buffer against some of these extremes, the survival of plants relies on species' ability to mitigate stress over a relatively short timescale. 

We are carying out common garden and transplant experiments to determine the contribution of adaptation and plasticity to the survival of plants in an urban landscape. We also aim to quantify the genetic variation of *Capsella bursa-pastoris* populations across cities, and identify the relatedness of these populations.

##### Mutational contribution to genotype-by-environment variation

While many studies have documented genotype-by-environment variation, few studies have looked at what causes this or what processes might change it. Here we looked at the contribution mutation to GxE. 

Mutation is the ultimate sourse of genetic variation, and therefore the basis of all evolution. However, most studies that have looked at how mutation changes across environments have mostly only considered a few fitness compenents, looked at two contrasting environments, and focused on the effects in plants, micro-organisms, and invetebrates. This leaves us with a knowledge gap on the effects of mutations in other complex phenotypes that are likley to contribute to survival, as well as across multiple environments, and in a vertebrate study system. 

In an atampt to look fill in some of these knowledge gaps, we looked at the mutational effects of locomotor performance across a temperature gradient in zebrafish.
