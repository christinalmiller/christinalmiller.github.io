My research interests lie in evolutionary biology and primarily aim to understand how organisms cope with rapid environmental heterogeneity. I have studied behaviour, micro-habitat, performance, and morphology of animals in environments that differ in temperature, structure, and community. Below is a brief outline of my research. Currently my research is in the field of quantitative genetics, with a main focus on genotype-by-environment interactions.


### Current Research

#### The plant evolution project

Urbanisation is happening on a rapid scale around the world, providing a new dynamic to many ecosystems. This process can often cause extremes in many abiotic factors.
While many animals can shift their ranges to help buffer against some of these extremes, the survival of plants relies on species' ability to mitigate stress over a relatively short timescale. |

We are carying out common garden and transplant experiments to determine the contribution of adaptation and plasticity to the survival of plants in an urban landscape. We also aim to quantify the genetic variation of *Capsella bursa-pastoris* populations across cities, and identify the relatedness of these populations.|
