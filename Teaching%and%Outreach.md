#### Outreach

###### Wonder of Science

During my PhD I joined the Wonder of Science team as a science ambassador. This program aims to bring STEM to remote aboriginal communities around Queensland, Australia.

This role was multifaceated and involved conducting science experiments inline with the school curriculum with primary school children and helping them present their results, giving leactures about my own career journey in science to secondary school children, and being involved in the G-STEM program, to demonstrate that anyone can become a scientist.

##### Workshops in the Amazon

For five weeks in the summer of 2017 I became a Science leader for the British Exploring Society on an expedition to the Peruvian Amazon. For four of those weeks, I camped in the jungle teaching volunteers about conservation biology and survey methods. Some of these methods included how to set up camera and mammal traps, how to collect diversity data on transects, and how to identify venomous vs non-venomous snake species.

The sixth week was spent in the community teaching locals about conservation in a small village called Salvacion. We helped build bio-gardens for some of the locals and helped out on agroforestry plots. We also held a workshop in a school to show the community what the volunteers had learnt from coming to the jungle. This was a great success and the community really enjoyed learning about our work in the jungle.


##### Outreach in Madagascar

During my role as a research officer in Madagascar I taught volunteers scientific methods and lead locals and volunteers on abundance and diversity surveys, helping them identify species. Part of my role was also to supervise volunteers on personal projects or on their undergraduate dissertation. Some volunteers came to complete a tropical conservation BTEC qualification (10 or 12 weeks), which I taught and graded.  

Additionally, on a Saturday morning myself and other research officers would head into the community and teach the locals about the environment. We would also visit schools and talk about wildlife conservation and embrace some of the local myths that helped to protect species.
